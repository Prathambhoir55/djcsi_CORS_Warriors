    "The input representation for the RNN explicitly encodes the order of words in the review. We'll return to the lists of the word indices contained in train_reviews['Review_Idxs']. The input to the model will be these number sequences themselves. We need to put all the reviews in the training set into a single matrix, where each row is a review and each column is a word index in that sequence. This enables the model to process multiple sequences in parallel (batches) as opposed to one at a time. Using batches significantly speeds up training. However, each review has a different number of words, so we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest review in the training set. For all reviews with fewer words, we prepend the row with zeros representing an empty word position. This is why the number 0 was not assigned as a word index in the lexicon. We can tell Keras to ignore these zeros during training."

As it observes each word in the review, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the review at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - we use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer (see the materials at the bottom for an explanation of the difference).

    "To help visualize the data representation inside the model, we can look at the output of each layer in a model individually. Keras' Functional API lets you derive a new model with the layers from an existing model, so you can define the output to be a layer below the output layer in the original model. Calling predict() on this new model will produce the output of that layer for a given input. Of course, glancing at the numbers by themselves doesn't provide any interpretation of what the model has learned (although there are opportunities to [interpret these values](https://medium.com/civis-analytics/interpreting-and-visualizing-neural-networks-for-text-processing-e9dff0da9c22), but seeing them verifies the model is just a series of transformations from one matrix to another. The model stores its layers as the list model.layers, and you can retrieve specific layer by its position index in the model."
